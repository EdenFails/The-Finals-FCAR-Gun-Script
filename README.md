This script controls the mouse when clicking in and will minimize the spray from the gun "FCAR" from the finals. it is not perfect but i didnt spend to much time on it

*Major Reduction on recoil*

## Usage
Download from release tab or copy the code into visual code to ensure its not malicious.
To use run the script and press the up arrow then shoot
if it didnt work the first time please close and open the script as it needed to install pywin32
if it still doesnt work then manually install pywin32 following online tutorials, i will not support you in getting this working as it should be simple.

## How it Works

The script utilizes python libraries for mouse control. It originally had a generic pattern as given by Chatgpt, but I customized it to demonstrate how you can tailor it to your needs. The pattern currently is made for FCAR
